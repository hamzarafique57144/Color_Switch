I created a game with the help of Youtube tutorial in which player have to Tap, switch, and match the color of bouncing ball to the ever-changing obstacles. The dynamic gameplay keeps you on your toes, requiring quick thinking and precision to progress through levels. With each successful switch, you unlock new challenges and unveil a mesmerizing cascade of colors.
